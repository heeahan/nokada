# ***Practice 1:*** ***Financial Transaction Log Management System***

## Project Goal

The goal is to develop a Financial Transaction Log Management System that includes the following features:

1. Upload and store transaction logs.
2. Paginated and dynamic search functionality for transaction logs (e.g., filter by date, amount range, status).
3. Role-based access control: Administrators can view all logs, while regular users can only access their own logs.
4. Marking abnormal data and exporting logs as reports.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Spring Boot + MyBatis
- Frontend: JSP + JSTL + Bootstrap
- Database: MySQL (Maybe Oracle a.k.a what I am using in the real pjt)
- Log Export: Apache POI (for Excel files)
- Dependency Management: Maven
